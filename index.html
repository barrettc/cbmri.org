        <p class="p1"> </p>
        <p class="p1"> </p>
        <p class="p3">CBMRI is a non-profit 501(c)3 "where discovery is realized through application".  CBMRI supports a unique biotechnology portfolio specializing in production of human antibodies that treat infectious diseases with non-toxic passive immunotherapy.  The CLONE 3 antibody technologies exist today that can stop the progression of the HIV/AIDS global pandemic internationally.  The CLONE 3 antibody anti-HIV/AIDS immunotherapeutics are a superior alternative to chemotherapeutic anti-retroviral drugs, which are known to be highly toxic to patients and are responsible for spawning fatal drug resistant forms of HIV internationally.  These non-toxic immunotherapies are:</p>
        <p class="p4"> </p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">(1) CLONE 3 antibody </span>- a fully human neutralizing antibody for therapeutic use in passive immunotherapy to treat any HIV+ patient and achieve an “absolute zero viral-load” preventing viral infectivity from individual to individual; </p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">(2)</span> <span class="s1">CLONE 3 paratope entry-fusion inhibitor </span>- a therapy derived from a subunit of the CLONE 3 <i>neutralizing</i> antibody’s molecular structure, to provide the same treatment efficacy as the primary CLONE 3 <i>neutralizing </i>antibody, with reduced production costs and simplified administrative and storage protocols;</p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">(3) CLONE 3 epitope entry-infusion inhibitor </span>- a therapy developed from a subunit of the viral binding site on the HIV viral isolate specific to the Clone 3 neutralizing antibody.  The Epitope Entry-Fusion Inhibitor provides the same treatment efficacy as the primary CLONE 3 neutralizing antibody; and  </p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">(4) CLONE 3 vaccine </span>- an “active” immunotherapy that can provide effective prophylactic humoral protection (sterile immunity) upon exposure to HIV/AIDS (useable by the world population of 6.6 billion individuals).</p>
        <p class="p6"><b> </b></p>
        <p class="p2"><b>CLONE 3 Global Capacities</b></p>
        <p class="p6"> </p>
        <p class="p3">As has been observed, the ability of HIV to mutate renders chemotherapies ineffective.  Such mutations do not affect CLONE 3 antibody’s ability to neutralize the HIV virus.  Specifically, CLONE 3 antibody and mini-antibody are effective against and bind to a portion of the virus that is immutable.  The CLONE 3 antibody has been shown to be greater than 98% effective <i> in vitro</i> in neutralizing HIV clinical isolates found in Africa, Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Australia, India, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and other geographic regions around the globe.  According to data from the U.S. Government’s National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, the CLONE 3 antibody can neutralize 98% of the 977 HIV viral isolates that have been clinically identified and mapped based upon the antibody’s targeted highly conserved viral surface amino acid immunogen, which is also the biological trigger that elicits the protective CLONE 3 human neutralizing antibody.  </p>
        <p class="p6"><b> </b></p>
        <p class="p2"><b>CLONE 3 Technology Discoveries</b></p>
        <p class="p6"> </p>
        <p class="p3">Dr. Joseph Cotropia, a physician, biochemist and immunologist, discovered CLONE 3 technologies by identifying and studying from the beginning of the AIDS epidemic twenty-five years ago, specific asymptomatic patients that are today referred to as Long-Term Non-Progressors (LTNPs) or HIV Elite Controllers (HIVECs).  This class of patients has the capacity to keep HIV in check through their own immune surveillance due to their ability to produce the CLONE 3 human neutralizing antibody.  These patients have normal T-cell counts, have no opportunistic infections, and do not require any adjunct chemotherapeutic antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), to maintain happy, healthy and productive lives.   Five independent international research institutes have validated Dr. Cotropia’s clinical research findings for LTNPs from different areas of the world.  Fundamentally, regardless of where LTNPs have been identified, they are all producing the CLONE 3 human neutralizing antibody.  This protective correlative discovery is Nature’s revealing a specific non-toxic immunotherapeutic solution to the HIV/AIDS global pandemic.</p>
        <p class="p4"> </p>
        <p class="p2"><b>Why are the CLONE 3 Technologies Unique?</b></p>
        <p class="p7"> </p>
        <p class="p3">Pharmaceutical companies have sought to control HIV/AIDS by using chemotherapeutic ARV drugs and studying DNA-based cellular immunity vaccines.  These approaches are wrought with difficulties because ARVs are highly toxic and DNA-based vaccines to date have not been demonstrated to elicit protective defenses to eradicate the virus (sterile immunity) and to be effective in establishing a permanent protective immune status against HIV exposure.  As demonstrated, these measures are not as effective as neutralizing human antibodies like CLONE 3, which can prevent viral infectivity from individual-to-individual.  Preventing viral infectivity has never been achieved by use of any combination of anti-retroviral drugs, which at best sustain a chronic infectious disease.  </p>
        <p class="p5"> </p>
        <p class="p3">Moreover, the HIV virus has proven quite adaptable in its ability to mutate worldwide rendering chemotherapeutic ARV drug protocols ineffective.  As a result of ARV drug use, pathogenic “super-viruses” that are drug resistant have been identified in major cities worldwide.  In contrast, the CLONE 3 technologies attack a non-varying immutable part of the HIV viral surface protein envelop.  Therefore, the CLONE 3 technologies’ effectiveness is significant and not diminished by HIV mutations.   Five to ten million individuals are infected annually and the progression of the HIV global pandemic has not yet been curtailed by use of today’s chemotherapeutic anti-retro viral drugs.</p>
        <p class="p6"><b> </b></p>
        <p class="p2"><b>Applying the Technology to Practice</b></p>
        <p class="p6"> </p>
        <p class="p3">CBMRI has initiated plans to test CLONE 3 technologies as a passive immunotherapy, entry-fusion inhibitor and as an "active" vaccine.  Specifically, CBMRI has scheduled Phase 1 clinical trials to be conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( <a href="http://www.mednet.ucla.edu/"><span class="s2">www.mednet.ucla.edu</span></a>), Los Angeles, CA.  Dr. Bryson is the Chief, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases as well as Chairperson, International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group for perinatal maternal HIV transmission.  Both principal medical investigators understand the clear significance of the CLONE 3 discoveries.  Now is the time to advance the CLONE 3 immunotherapeutics and launch Phase 1 clinical trials.</p>
        <p class="p6"><b> </b></p>
        <p class="p2"><b>Considerations</b></p>
        <p class="p6"> </p>
        <p class="p3">Gross annual revenues on chemotherapeutic ARVs reached $40 billion worldwide in 2002, and passed the annual $127 billion mark at the close of 2005.  The CLONE 3 technologies are the only unique non-toxic therapies today that can prevent viral infectivity of HIV from individual-to-individual and stop the HIV/AIDS global pandemic.   On behalf of HIV/AIDS patients, CBMRI is looking for partnering collaborators and champions to help advance these effective anti-HIV immunotherapeutics.  </p>
